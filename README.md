save_box_fake.py : Stage 1 -> Threshold-based Classification

pytorch_kitti/main.py : Stage2 -> DGCNN-based Classification

sn2_final.py : Run sn2_1stage.py, sn2_2stage.py, and sn2_filter.py sequentially to measure the performance for Scenario 2 

This project is inspired by and builds upon the methods described in the [WangYueFt/dgcnn repository](https://github.com/WangYueFt/dgcnn).
